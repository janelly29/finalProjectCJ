# finalProjectCJ

This project is based off the 3 integrated rate laws in chemistry that involve graphing 
time vs Molar Concentration of chemical reactions. 

How to run our Program :
1) Call for the function finalProject in the command window, making sure that you have no inputs
2) An empty plot figure will appear
3) You can insert a title for your graph such as "Concentration vs time Rate Laws"
    a)make sure to delete the text in the box
4) Insert numerical values into the two other text boxes that say "Enter time values" and "Enter concentration values"
5)after you've inserted your values, click on button of which rate law you wish to plot 
    a) at the top can be zero, first, or second order. 
6)a graph should appear as a dashed line with stars to mark the points
7)you can click between plot buttons to change the view of what rate law reaction you'd like to see
8)if you wish to clear, simply press the clear plot button
